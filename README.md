# A/B Testing Project

## Introduction
This notebook walks through an A/B split test on a feature aimed to improve conversions in the first step of a three step checkout funnel. In the first step of the checkout flow, customers enter personal data in a 6 field form. The new and improve feature is able to get some of this personal data from a data vendor at a cost, but reduces the form fields from 6 to 5. 

## Contents
The notebook covers data cleaning and EDA, power analysis, minimum sample size assessment, and hypothesis testing.
